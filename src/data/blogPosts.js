        title: "The Silent Revolution: How AI Agents are Running Factory Floors",
        excerpt: "From predictive maintenance to automated SOP retrieval, discover how autonomous agents are reducing downtime and empowering floor staff in modern manufacturing.",
        content: `
            <p>The manufacturing sector is undergoing a seismic shift. It's no longer just about automation in the physical sense—robotic arms and assembly lines. The new frontier is <strong>cognitive automation</strong>.</p>
            
            <h2>The Problem with Traditional Ops</h2>
            <p>In a typical factory, knowledge is siloed. SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) are buried in binders or PDFs. When a machine fails, the operator has to call a supervisor, who calls a technician, who looks up a manual. This chain of command costs time—and in manufacturing, time is literally money.</p>

            <h2>Enter the Factory Ops Agent</h2>
            <p>Imagine an AI agent that lives on a tablet at every workstation. It has "read" every manual, safety protocol, and maintenance log in the company's history.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Instant Troubleshooting:</strong> "Why is the CNC machine vibrating?" The agent analyzes the query against error codes and suggests a fix immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Before a high-risk procedure, the agent quizzes the operator on safety steps, ensuring compliance.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictive Alerts:</strong> By integrating with IoT sensors, the agent warns of failure <em>before</em> it happens.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At Meghavi AI, our <strong>Factory Ops Agent</strong> is designed to bridge the gap between human operators and complex machinery, reducing downtime by up to 40%.</p>

        excerpt: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is transforming legal tech. Learn how AI paralegals can search millions of precedents in seconds.",
        content: `
            <p>Legal research is grueling. Associates spend countless hours combing through case law, looking for that one precedent that could swing a verdict. It's a process ripe for disruption.</p>

            <h2>What is RAG in Law?</h2>
            <p><strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> allows an AI to search a specific, trusted database (like a firm's internal archives or a legal repository) and generate answers based <em>only</em> on that data. This eliminates hallucinations—a critical requirement in law.</p>

            <h2>The Meghavi Legal Bot</h2>
            <p>Our specialized Legal Agent allows advocates to ask complex questions: <em>"Find me cases in the Delhi High Court regarding breach of contract due to force majeure in 2020."</em></p>
            <p>The result isn't just a list of links. It's a summarized memo, citing specific paragraphs and outcomes. This frees up lawyers to focus on strategy and argumentation rather than data retrieval.</p>

        content: `
            <p>The renewable energy boom is here. But for Solar EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) companies, the bottleneck isn't technology—it's sales.</p>

            <h2>The Lead Qualification Bottleneck</h2>
            <p>Marketing campaigns generate thousands of leads. But calling each one to ask for electricity bills, roof photos, and location data is inefficient. Most leads go cold before a human can reach them.</p>

            <h2>The Solar Qualify Agent</h2>
            <p>Our agent lives on WhatsApp and the web. It engages leads instantly:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Asks for the monthly electricity bill amount.</li>
                <li><strong>Roof Analysis:</strong> Uses satellite data to estimate roof area and solar potential.</li>
                <li><strong>ROI Calculation:</strong> Instantly shows potential savings.</li>
                <li><strong>Booking:</strong> Schedules a site visit for the sales team.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This ensures that your human sales team only talks to educated, qualified homeowners who are ready to buy.</p>

        content: `
            <p>We've all used ChatGPT. It's a great singular assistant. But running a business requires a team. That's where <strong>Swarm Intelligence</strong> comes in.</p>

            <h2>Orchestrating the Hive</h2>
            <p>In a Swarm architecture, a "Master Node" breaks down a complex goal (e.g., "Launch a new marketing campaign") into sub-tasks and delegates them to specialized agents:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Researcher Agent:</strong> Scrapes the web for competitor analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Copywriter Agent:</strong> Drafts emails and ad copy based on the research.</li>
                <li><strong>Designer Agent:</strong> Generates image assets.</li>
                <li><strong>Reviewer Agent:</strong> Checks everything against brand guidelines.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Meghavi AI's "The Swarm" solution brings this level of autonomous coordination to the enterprise, turning weeks of work into minutes of processing.</p>

            <p>By removing friction from the pre-sales process, dealerships can see a 30% increase in footfall and test drives.</p>
